# Request Tracker
RT is an enterprise-grade issue tracking system. It allows organizations
to keep track of what needs to get done, who is working on which tasks,
what's already been done, and when tasks were (or weren't) completed.

# Preface
Previously we learned how to update our OS, install and configure our database, and ensure we have all dependencies needed for the installation of Request Tracker. For my installation I am using CentOS Stream 9, MySQL 5.7 with InnoDB support, Request Tracker 5.0.4, and Apache 2. 

After this tutorial we will have a working installation of Request Tracker 5.0.4 with MySQL 5.7 with InnoDB support. In the last step of this tutorial we will install and configure our web and mail server:

**1. Dependencies and Database**

**2.Request Tracker Installation and Configuration**

3.Web and Mail Server Configuration

# Download and install RT5
First we will download RT 5.0.4.
```bash
wget https://download.bestpractical.com/pub/rt/release/rt-5.0.4.tar.gz
```
Next we will extract the archive
```bash
tar xzvf rt-5.0.4.tar.gz
```
Now we will traverse to our RT directory and install the base pearl dependencies.
```bash
sudo make dirs
make fixdeps RT_FIX_DEPS_CMD="cpanm --sudo"
sudo cpanm DBD::mysql
```
Now we will test our dependencies and install.
```bash
sudo make testdeps
sudo make install
```
# Create new database, or import old database and upgrade
## New Database

## Import RT4 database and upgrade
We will install necessary dependencies, create our rt5 database, and import our old database.
```bash
sudo yum install cifs-utils
mysql -uroot -p

CREATE DATABASE rt5;
quit;

gunzip -c rt-olddatabase-name.sql.gz | mysql -uroot -p rt5
```
This will take a while to run, after it is finished run these commands to check that it worked:
```bash
mysql -uroot -p

show databases;
use rt5;
show tables;

SELECT 
table_name AS `Table`, 
	round(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024), 2) `Size in MB` 
FROM 
	information_schema.TABLES
WHERE 
	table_schema = "rt5";
```
Now we will navigate to our rt download and run the database upgrade scripts.
```bash
cd ~
cd rt-5.0.4
sudo make upgrade
sudo make upgrade-database
```
After running upgrade-database click space twice, this step will take a while depending on the size of the database you are upgrading.
```bash
sudo rm -rf /opt/rt5/var/mason_data/obj
```
# Configure RT5
Now we will configure RT5 for our own purposes.
```bash
sudo nano /opt/rt5/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
```
```bash
sudo cpan install Net::LDAP
sudo /opt/rt5/sbin/rt-setup-fulltext-index --noask
```
The end of the process will output some RT configuration that looks like this:
```bash
### EXAMPLE OUTPUT ONLY - Don't use this directly!
		Set( %FullTextSearch,
			Enable     => 1,
			Indexed    => 1,
			# Additional output from rt-setup-fulltext-index should be here.
			# The configuration varies by database type.
            );
```
Copy the output generated when you run rt-setup-fulltext-index and save it to the file /opt/rt5/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
```bash
cd ~
cd rt- 5.0.4
sudo make fixperms
```
This completes part 2 of the tutorial, in the next section we will install and configure our web and mail servers.
